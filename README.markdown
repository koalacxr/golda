# GOLDA

A super-basic and work-in-progress implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation in Go. Ported from a Python implementation by Aaron Cohen, with a few minor tweaks. Takes advantage of goroutines for parallelization of repeated model-fitting runs.

##TODO:

0. Do whatever one does with a Go program to allow it to be imported directly (e.g., `import http://github.com/stevenbedrick/golda`).
1. Complete the implementation (allow serialization of models, etc.)
2. Implement hyperparameter tuning?
